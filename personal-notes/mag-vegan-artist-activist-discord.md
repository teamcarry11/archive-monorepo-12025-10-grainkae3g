> "You are about to be confronted with the radical view that an animal's life is worth more than a sandwich. Proceed at your own risk. Viewer discretion is advised."

- Food pics
- Resources

**Aesthetic**: Pastel pink/teal, pixel-art cow icons, heart backgrounds, friendly/cheerful despite serious content

---

## Philosophy

**"An animal's life is worth more than a sandwich"**

**Alignment with other advocates**:
- Seb Alex: "The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all injustice"
- Claudia Kuper: "ANIMALS ARE HERE WITH US NOT FOR US"
- Mag: "An animal's life is worth more than a sandwich"

**All three**: Direct, clear, unapologetic about animal value

**Mag's unique angle**: Humor + seriousness (content warning is witty but means it)

---

## Discord Activity

**Voice Connected**: Veganism Room 1 / Veg (active voice chat participant)

**Text channels engaged**:
- #veganism (currently active)
- Likely: #general, #help-me-go-vegan, #recipes, #how-to-go-vegan

**Role as Mentor**: Guides new vegans, answers questions, provides support

---

## Connection to Grain Network

### **1. Happy Vault Vibes**

**Mag's aesthetic**: Pink, cheerful, friendly (despite radical content)

**For team02 (Venus/Taurus)**:
- Happy vault imagery (not dark/threatening security)
- Cheerleader energy (supporting, encouraging)
- Paradise on earth (Besties Vegan Paradise vibes!)
- Subtle security (in background, not foregrounded)

**Mag's content warning** = Happy vault philosophy:
- Serious content (animal lives matter)
- Delivered with lightness (pixel cows, pastel pink)
- Not aggressive (proceed at your own risk = your choice)

---

### **2. Multi-Modal Advocacy** (like Claudia)

**Mag does**:
- Art (visual creative)
- Fitness (embodied practice)
- Veganism (ethics, activism)
- Media Log (content curation)

**Chartcourse parallel**:
- Code (tools)
- Documentation (education)
- Art (grainwriter, beautiful UI)
- Philosophy (PSEUDO, vision docs)

**Both**: Don't choose one mode, integrate all modes

---

### **3. Discord as Organizing Platform**

**3 mutual servers = vegan organizing hub**:
- Vegan World (general community, voice rooms)
- Animal Rights Advocates (specific cause focus)
- Total Liberation (radical/intersectional, anarchy symbol)

**Current reality**:
- Discord = centralized (Discord Inc. owns data)
- Voice rooms = ephemeral (no persistent archive)
- Text channels = searchable but not sovereign

**grainp2p opportunity**:
- Urbit ships for persistent, sovereign chat
- IPFS for file sharing (not Discord CDN)
- Encrypted coordination (more secure than Discord)

**But**:
- Don't replace Discord immediately (community is there NOW)
- Offer as alternative/backup (sovereignty-conscious activists)
- Bridge both (grainp2p ↔ Discord integration?)

---

### **4. Artist + Activist Integration**

**Mag's combination**: Art (beauty) + activism (justice)

**For chartcourse/grainwriter**:
- Beautiful documentation (not just functional)
- Art in service of justice (pixel cows = cute but serious)
- Aesthetics matter (pastel pink veganism vs. dark/gritty activism)

**The lesson**: You can be serious AND joyful (not either/or)

### **Black Vegan Influencers** (related research)

**Major figures** (from FeedSpot Top 60):
1. **Tabitha Brown** (@iamtabithabrown) - Actress, fragrance co-founder, "Lover of humanity"
2. **Alexis Nikole Nelson** (@blackforager, 3M followers) - Foraging teacher, environmental sci

4. **Koya Webb** (Yoga, fitness, wellness)
5. **Todd Anderson** (@badassvegan)
6. **Lloyd Rose**

- @black_girlvegan (Nia M., Durham NC, therapist + vegan lifestyle)
- @myblackgirlroots (TriDereka Hall, 208K, "Vegan & Plant Based Mom")

- Potential partners for grainp2p (decentralized organizing)

## Team02 Reimagining (HappyVault)

**Old concept**: Security vault, hoarding, protecting (negative connotations)

**New concept**: Happy vault, cheerleading, paradise vibes

**Mag's influence**:
- Pink/teal cheerful aesthetic
- Serious content, joyful delivery
- "Vault" as treasure chest (not fortress)
- Sharing secrets (not hoarding)

**HappyVault app**: 
- Store secrets WITH joy (not paranoia)
- Share passwords WITH trust (not fear)
- Backup data WITH ease (not anxiety)
- Pole vaulting imagery (launching upward, not hiding)

**Venus/Taurus**: Beauty, pleasure, abundance (not scarcity/fear)

---

2. Create grainservers module (3 vegan Discord servers)
3. Follow magscorner.carrd.co (engage with her content)
