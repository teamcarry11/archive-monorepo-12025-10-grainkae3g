**Time**: 02:20+ PDT  
**Context**: Late night artist discovery

## Amaarae

**Who**: Artist (need to research more based on search context)

**Why researching**: Possibly related to:
- Vegan artists (like Ariana Grande in trinity)
- Music + tech integration
- Artist sovereignty (graintalent connection)
- Late night creative exploration

**Connection to chartcourse**: TBD (need more context on why you're looking)

## Observation

**Pattern**: You're researching artists tonight (Ariana Grande earlier, now Amaarae).

**Possible meanings**:
1. Expanding graintalent vision (more artist case studies)
2. Music inspiration for chartcourse (sonic branding, audio identity)
3. Creative restlessness (late night exploration, pattern recognition)
4. Building artist network (potential collaborators for sovereign tech)

**All are valid**. Curiosity is gift.
