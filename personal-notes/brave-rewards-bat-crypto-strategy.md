   - Consumer purchases under $1,000
   - Fast finality (2-second blocks)

2. **BAT → Hedera** (Hashgraph)
   - Use for wholesale/B2B layer
   - Enterprise transactions $1K-$100K
   - Fixed low fees, regulatory compliance

3. **BAT → Solana** (L1/L2)
   - Use for large transactions + micropayments
   - High throughput (65,000 TPS)
   - DeFi composability

## Trading Platforms

**Centralized Exchanges (CEX)**:
- Binance, Coinbase, Kraken (BAT → major pairs)

**Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**:
- Uniswap (BAT → ETH → bridge to other chains)
- Jupiter (Solana DEX aggregator)

**BAT-Specific Opportunities**:
- Solana staking: "Lock $BAT on Solana, earn $GUANO"
- NFT burning: "Use SOL incinerator to get BAT"
- Quest completion: Earn BAT through platform activities

## Integration with Grain Network Commerce

- ICP canister deployment (retail commerce)

- Solana program deployment (DeFi integration)
- Multi-chain liquidity pools

4. **Monitor**: Track 30-day ad history
5. **Convert**: When threshold reached, convert BAT → ICP/Hedera/Solana

## Alignment with Grain Network Vision

Brave Rewards aligns perfectly with our philosophy:
- **Privacy-first**: Respects user sovereignty (like grainOS)
- **Decentralized**: Blockchain-based rewards (like our multi-chain vision)
- **Ethical**: User-owned attention economy (like vegan commerce principles)
- **Open-source**: Brave is open-source (like Grain Network)

The BAT earned becomes seed capital for building the vegan multi-chain commerce platform described in Patent #5.
