## 🔍 RESEARCH ACTIVITY

At 21:13 PDT on October 27, 2025, searched Google Images for **"hyperboloid definition"**.

This follows directly from implementing Ken Wheeler's **φ³ hyperboloid model** for the Steel + Svelte tap-only navigation grainsite.

### Why This Matters

Wheeler's magnetism work describes the magnetic vortex as a **φ³ hyperboloid** - a specific 3D geometric shape where:
- The cross-section is circular (or elliptical)
- The shape "pinches" inward following φ³ (phi cubed) decay
- It's the geometry of dielectric-magnetic field interaction!

### The Hyperboloid Equation

```
x²/a² + y²/b² - z²/c² = 1

Where:
a = b = 1 (circular cross-section)
c = φ³ = 4.236... (vortex depth scaling)
```

### Application to Graincards

Our tap-only navigation creates a **visual hyperboloid**:
- Level 0 (top): Full 100×75 graincard (widest point)
- Level 1-4: Progressive φ-zoom inward (pinching)
- Level 5 (bottom): Seed point (narrowest - dielectric inertial plane!)

The **137.5077° golden angle rotation** per tap creates the **spiral** around the hyperboloid axis!

### Visual Connection

Looking at hyperboloid images helps understand:
1. How the vortex **narrows** as you spiral inward
2. Why the golden angle creates **optimal packing**
3. The **double-cone** shape of magnetic field lines
4. How **counterspace** (inward) mirrors **space** (outward)

## 🌊 NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Create SVG visualization of φ³ hyperboloid for grainsite
- [ ] Animate the hyperboloid rotation (137.5077° per tap)
- [ ] Show user's current position on the hyperboloid (you are here!)
- [ ] Add 3D WebGL view (optional, for desktop)
