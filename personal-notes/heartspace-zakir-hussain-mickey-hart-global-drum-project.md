## Personal Context

Listening to this during the grainscript development session (Oct 27, 2025, 00:53) while working on Ketos validators and flowing Da Vinci-style prose for grains. The global collaboration of percussion traditions mirrors our approach to building the Grain Network - bringing together different systems (Ketos, Clojure, Rust) into one coherent musical whole.

The concept of "Heartspace" resonates with the grainscript philosophy: creating space for knowledge to breathe, for teaching to flow, for wisdom to find its rhythm.
