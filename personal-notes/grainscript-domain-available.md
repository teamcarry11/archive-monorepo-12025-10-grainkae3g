# Personal Note: grainscript Domain Available

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Author**: kae3g  
**Context**: Ember Harvest session, discovering the perfect name

## The Discovery 🎃

While renaming `grainbook-scripts` to `grainscripts` (because it's like movie scripts + code scripts + typewriter manuscripts), checked domain availability:

**Available on Squarespace Domains:**
- `grainscript.com` - $14 (was $20) - ⭐ **Closest match**
- `grainscript.net` - $14 (was $20)
- `grainscript.org` - $9 (was $20)
- `grain-script.com` - $14 (was $20)
- `grainscripts.com` - $14 (was $20)
- `grainscript.store` - $4 (was $20) 🏷️ Promotion
- `grainscript.online` - $4 (was $20) 🏷️ Promotion

## The Vision

**grainscript** perfectly captures:
1. **Code scripts** - Automation, Babashka, Ketos
2. **Movie scripts** - Screenplay, manuscript, storytelling
3. **Typewriter aesthetic** - Monospace, vintage, 80×110 format
4. **Graincard teaching** - Each card is a "script" to follow

Like how we have:
- `chartcourse.io` for navigation + education
- `grainscript.com` could be for scripts + stories

## Domain Strategy

Current portfolio:
- ✅ `chartcourse.io` (navigation/education brand)
- ✅ `chartcourse.net` (redirect)
- ✅ `chartcourse.org` (redirect)
- 🎃 `grainscript.com` (scripts/stories brand) - **AVAILABLE**

## Perfect Timing

Discovered this during the Ember Harvest session, right after:
- Creating 4 graincards (xbdghj → xbdghn)
- Deploying Ember Harvest theme
- Building the 80×110 monospace format
- Channeling Glow G2 teaching voice

The name "grainscript" emerged naturally from the work. It wasn't forced. It just... appeared. Like finding grain in the harvest. 🌾

## Next Steps

Consider for future:
1. Register `grainscript.com` (or .org for nonprofit vibe?)
2. Make it the home for all graincards
3. 1,235,520 scripts/stories/cards
4. Typewriter aesthetic site
5. Monospace everything
6. Movie/book/manuscript vibe

**Connection to Names Reference:**
- Helen Atthowe (veganic farming) → growing grain
- Leonardo da Vinci (manuscripts) → writing scripts
- Ariana Grande (performance) → reading the script

**Philosophy:**
Every graincard is a script. A set of instructions. A story to follow. A teaching manuscript. From seed (idea) to harvest (knowledge) to script (implementation).
