## Why This Matters

Barefoot shoes align with Grain Network philosophy:
- **Minimal** (like our tools)
- **Intentional** (conscious choice)
- **Natural** (not forcing unnatural shape)
- **Functional** (protection + freedom)

Work boots that are also barefoot = Function + Philosophy

Like SixOS: Minimal + Powerful

## The Connection

**Keen** makes barefoot work boots.  
**Grain Network** makes barefoot computing.

Both: Remove unnecessary layers while keeping essential protection.
