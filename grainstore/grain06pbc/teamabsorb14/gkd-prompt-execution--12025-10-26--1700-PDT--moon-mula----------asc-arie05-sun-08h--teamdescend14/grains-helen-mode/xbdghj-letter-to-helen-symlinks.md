│ dear helen,                                                                  │

│ i'm writing to you from my forest cabin in caspar, california, thinking     │
│ about your veganic farm in montana and how the wisdom of your soil teaches  │
│ me about code. today i want to share something that connects your world to  │
│ mine in a way that surprised me with its beauty.                             │
│                                                                              │
│ you have many garden beds on your farm, each one a temporal snapshot of     │
│ what you planted in a specific season. some beds hold spring lettuces that  │
│ have already gone to seed. some hold summer tomatoes ripening in the sun.   │
│ some hold fall brassicas just beginning to form heads. each bed tells the   │
│ story of when it was planted, what the weather was like, what you were      │
│ learning that season about companion planting and soil fertility.           │
│                                                                              │
│ but when visitors arrive at your farm, they see only one entrance sign.     │
│ how do you make that sign point them to the bed that's ready for harvest    │
│ right now? how does the surface (the entrance) reflect the depths (all      │
│ those seasonal beds scattered across your land)?                             │
│                                                                              │
│ in my code work, i face the same beautiful problem. my repository (like     │
│ your farm) has many "branches" (like your garden beds). each branch         │
│ captures work from a specific moment, timestamped with astronomical data    │
│ about when the moon was and what was rising on the eastern horizon. but     │
│ github (like your farm entrance) shows only one README file at the root.    │
│                                                                              │
│ the solution comes from unix wisdom, and it reminded me so much of how you  │
│ work with nature: symbolic links. instead of copying content or maintaining │
│ duplicates (like trying to replicate your entire farm at the entrance), we  │
│ create an elegant pointer. a sign that says "the harvest you seek is in     │
│ the south garden today, follow this path."                                   │
│                                                                              │
│ the code looks like this:                                                    │
│                                                                              │
│ ln -sf grainstore/grain06pbc/teamabsorb14/current-branch/README.md README.md│
│                                                                              │
│ that's it. one command. the root README doesn't contain content - it points │
│ to content, just like your farm entrance sign doesn't contain vegetables,   │
│ it points toward the beds where vegetables grow.                             │
│                                                                              │
│ what happens next feels like the kind of elegant simplicity you achieve in  │
│ your farming: the boundary between root and branch dissolves. visitors to   │
│ the repository see the current branch's README as if it were the root       │
│ itself. one truth expressing itself in two locations, like how the same     │
│ soil microbiome lives in your compost pile and in your garden beds,         │
│ connected through the cycles you tend so carefully.                          │
│                                                                              │
│ when you switch which bed you're actively harvesting, you update the sign.  │
│ when i switch which branch i'm actively developing, i update the symlink.   │
│ the surface stays synchronized with the depths. the entrance reflects the   │
│ current work. visitors always find what's ready now.                         │
│                                                                              │
│ does this make sense? i'm learning from your book "the ecological farm"     │
│ that the best systems are the ones that work with natural patterns rather   │
│ than fighting them. symbolic links feel like that - they work with how      │
│ unix naturally handles files (everything is a file, even pointers to        │
│ files) the same way your farming works with how soil naturally handles      │
│ nutrients (everything returns to soil, even the plants that grew from it).  │
│                                                                              │
│ you've taught thousands of people through your farm apprenticeships. i'm    │
│ trying to teach through these "grains" - knowledge cards that work on any   │
│ device, from terminals to e-ink readers to phones in airplane mode. 80      │
│ characters wide, 110 lines tall, like the dimensions of a classical         │
│ flashcard but filled with flowing prose instead of terse definitions.       │
│                                                                              │
│ this first grain teaches about symbolic links because it demonstrates the   │
│ pattern appearing everywhere in this work: the outer points to the inner,   │
│ the surface reveals the depth, form teaches emptiness. the same pattern you │
│ embody when you point visitors toward the garden bed ready for harvest.     │
│                                                                              │
│ with deep respect for your life's work teaching ecological wisdom,          │
│                                                                              │
