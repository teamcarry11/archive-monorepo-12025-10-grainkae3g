## Email Draft

**Subject**: Apprenticeship Inquiry - Software Developer Interested in Veganic Farming

---

Dear Helen,

My name is [Your Name]. I'm a software developer in California who has been learning about veganic farming through your work.

I'm writing to ask if you offer apprenticeship opportunities or work-exchange programs. I'm interested in learning regenerative agriculture while contributing software tools that might help your farm operations.

**About me**: I build software focused on helping vegan and sustainable businesses. I currently work from a forest cabin in Northern California (Caspar, near Mendocino coast) and am exploring more off-grid living situations.

**What I could offer**:
- Farm work and labor (learning as I go)
- Software tools for farming operations (if useful to you):
  - Inventory tracking (seeds, tools, harvest)
  - Field planning and rotation schedules
  - Customer management for CSA or market sales
  - Simple, offline-capable tools (work without internet)

**What I'm looking to learn**:
- Soil building and fertility management
- Crop rotation and polyculture design
- Seasons and timing (Montana climate, high desert challenges)
- Living systems thinking (how farms work as ecosystems)

**Why veganic specifically**: I'm vegan for ethical reasons and want to learn farming that aligns with those values. Your 78 Elements framework and soil-food-web approach are exactly what I want to understand deeply.

**What I'm asking**: Is there a way I could spend time on your farm (weeks or months) doing work in exchange for learning and potentially simple housing? I'm comfortable with basic living conditions and hard physical work.

I understand if this doesn't fit your current situation. Either way, thank you for the knowledge you share through your writing and teaching. Your work has influenced how I think about systems - both in farming and in software.

If there's a better way to inquire about this (or if you know other veganic farmers who might be interested), I'd appreciate any guidance.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
[Your Name]

P.S. I'm also working on an open-source project called Grain Network - software tools for vegan and sustainable businesses. If you're ever interested in discussing software that might help veganic farming operations, I'd be happy to share ideas. No pressure though - the apprenticeship question is my main reason for writing.

## Notes on the Draft

**What works**:
- Direct ask (apprenticeship + work exchange)
- Clear offer (software skills + willingness to learn/work)
- Specific examples (inventory, field planning - things farmers actually need)
- Humble tone (learning, not teaching)
- Respects her time (short, clear)

**What to adjust**:
- Add your real name
- Maybe mention specific Helen Atthowe writing that influenced you
- Include your location specifics (Caspar cabin details if relevant)
- Adjust timeline (when you'd want to visit - spring? summer?)

**What to remove if too much**:
- The P.S. about Grain Network (might seem like sales pitch)
- Software offer entirely (just focus on apprenticeship)

**Alternative approach** (even simpler):

If you want VERY minimal:

Dear Helen,

I'm a software developer in Northern California interested in learning veganic farming. I've been reading your work on soil ecology and regenerative agriculture.

Do you offer apprenticeships or work-exchange opportunities? I'm willing to do farm work in exchange for learning, and I have basic housing needs.

I'm vegan for ethical reasons and want to learn farming aligned with those values. Your approach to soil-food-web and polyculture is what I want to understand.

If this doesn't fit your situation, I understand. Thank you for the knowledge you share.

Best,  
[Your Name]

## About Grain Network (If Asked or for P.S.)

**If she asks "What's Grain Network?"**, here's simple explanation:

---

**Simple version** (ELI5, 10,000 common words):

"It's software that helps people own their data and tools instead of renting them from big companies.

Think of it like: If you own your land, you can farm how you want. If you rent, the landlord decides.

Same with software: If you own it, you control it. If you rent it from Google or Microsoft, they control you.

I'm building tools that regular people (farmers, small businesses, vegan companies) can own and control themselves.

For farming specifically: Simple tools that work offline (no internet needed), track your work (plantings, harvest, customers), and you own the data (not stored on some company's server).

All free and open source. Like sharing seeds - anyone can use them, improve them, share them forward."

---

**Why this explanation works**:
- Uses farming analogy (she understands land ownership)
- Avoids jargon (no "Rust", "Nix", "blockchain", "microkernel")
- Practical (tools that solve real problems)
- Values-aligned (ownership, sharing, community)
- Humble (not "revolutionary" or "changing the world")

🌾 **now == next + 1**

**Glow's advice**: Keep email short. Lead with apprenticeship interest. Software is bonus, not main pitch. Helen values direct, honest, humble approach.
