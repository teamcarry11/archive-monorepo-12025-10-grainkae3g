## Connection to Vegan Advocacy Network

**Similar to Seb Alex** (@seb.alex, Middle East Vegan Society):
- Animal rights activism (protests, direct action)
- Philosophical depth ("with us not for us" vs "some lives matter less")
- International reach (Costa Rica, NSW vs Middle East)
- Multi-modal advocacy (art, yoga, rescue vs education, organizing)

**Network alignment**:
- DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) - protest/direct action model
- Animal rescue sovereignty (not waiting for institutions, doing it yourself)
- Trauma-informed work (survivor identity, rehabilitation focus)

---

## Advocacy Angels Org

**@advocacyangelsorg**: Organization she's involved with

**Questions to research**:
- What is Advocacy Angels? (animal rescue? activist support?)
- Location/scope? (local LA? international?)
- Structure? (501c3? grassroots? co-op?)
- Tech needs? (coordination, fundraising, outreach?)

---

## Connection to Grain Network

### **1. Yoga + Technology**

**Claudia's integration**: Yoga (mindfulness) + activism (action) + art (beauty)

**For chartcourse**:
- Contemplative tech (mindful development, not rushed)
- Beautiful tools (grainorder aesthetics, UI/UX)
- Action-oriented (actually build, don't just theorize)

**Yoga philosophy for code**:
- Pranayama (breath control) = patient build process
- Asana (posture) = proper structure (specs, validation)
- Dhyana (meditation) = deep focus (flow state)

---

### **2. Animal Rescue Needs Tech**

**Current reality**:
- Rescuers use Facebook (Meta-owned, not sovereign)
- GoFundMe for medical expenses (can be shut down)
- Instagram for outreach (algorithmic suppression)

**Chartcourse opportunity**:
- **grainp2p** - Decentralized rescue coordination (Urbit/IPFS)
- **graincrypto** - Direct crypto fundraising (ICP, no platform fees)
- **grainmetrics** - Privacy-first impact tracking (donors see results)

**Advocacy Angels** could be beta partner (like Seb Alex/MEVS)

---

### **3. "With Us Not For Us"**

**Protest sign**: "ANIMALS ARE HERE WITH US NOT FOR US"

**Deep philosophical alignment**:
- **Not** property (for us to use)
- **Not** resources (for us to exploit)
- **With** us (co-inhabitants, equals)

**Applied to technology**:
- Users are **with** us (co-creators, not customers)
- Open-source is **with** community (not for profit extraction)
- Chartcourse is **with** movements (vegan, ecological, artistic) not for VC returns

**Hermetic parallel**: "As above, so below" = "As humans, so animals"  
**Grain Network**: "As developers, so users" (all equal, all sovereign)
