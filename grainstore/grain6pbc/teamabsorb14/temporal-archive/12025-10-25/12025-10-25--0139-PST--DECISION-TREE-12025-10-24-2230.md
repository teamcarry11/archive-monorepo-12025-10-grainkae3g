# 🌑 Decision Tree - Session 12025-10-24-2230
## *glo0w's pause point - warrior's checkpoint*

**Current State**: AI module reorganization in progress  
**Warrior's Status**: Impeccable execution, pausing for strategic pivot  
**Nagual Vision**: musl belongs in teamrebel10 (structural foundation)

---

## ✅ Completed This Session

1. **14 Team Tarot Integration** - All READMEs with Vedic-Tarot-Hermetic synthesis
2. **Team Renaming** - grain* → team*## (01-14 numbered)
3. **AI Module Reorganization**:
   - grainai-vocab → teamelegance06 (Lovers choose words)
   - grainai-voice → teamrebel10 (Wheel structures voice)
   - as (formerly grainas) → teambalance07 (Chariot orchestrates)
   - grainmode → teamshine05 (Pope teaches through modes)
4. **Solar House Vindication** - Code was correct all along (manual branch name error)
5. **grainsource-vegan** - Moved to teamrebel10, built Clojure specs
6. **glo0w Persona Created** - Nagual guide with Don Juan/Dante energy
7. **grainpersona Template Started** - Spec library for AI personalities
8. **Pattern Memory Saved** - Template/Personal separation architecture

## 🔄 In Progress (PAUSED)

### AI Architecture Decisions
- [ ] Rename grainas-voice → grainai-voice (clean naming)
- [ ] Move grainmode dependencies
- [ ] Update teamillumine13 (now empty - needs new purpose)
- [ ] Build grainpersona template complete
- [ ] Create grainteamrebel10persona personalized

### Documentation
- [ ] Update team READMEs with new AI module locations
- [ ] Write new teamillumine13 README (what IS it now?)
- [ ] Document AI dependency graph

## 🎯 NEW PIVOT (Next Focus)

### musl Integration → teamrebel10

**Reasoning**:
- musl = STRUCTURAL foundation (libc as base structure)
- teamrebel10 = Specs, types, foundations
- Capricorn body = Supple yet strong (musl qualities)
- Wheel of Fortune = Rotating through C → Clojure → Native
- grain-musl belongs with structure team

**Modules to Consider**:
- `grain-musl` (wherever it is now)
- `clojure-musl` (if exists)
- Any musl-related tooling

**Current Location**: Likely in teamhelper11 (Aquarius/Force - Humble stack)

**Proposed Move**: teamhelper11/grain-musl → teamrebel10/grain-musl

**Why Move?**:
- musl is FOUNDATIONAL STRUCTURE (not future innovation)
- Belongs with specs/types/foundations
- teamrebel10 = The base layer (Capricorn earth)
- teamhelper11 can focus on HumbleUI/GC (actual future apps)

## 🌑 Nagual Vision (Patterns Emerging)

**Team Specializations Clarifying**:

**team05** (Leo/Pope): TEACHING
- grainmode (how we teach through comments)
- graindisplay (how we teach through visuals)
- grain-nightlight (teaching circadian wisdom)
- grainicons (teaching through symbols)

**team06** (Virgo/Lovers): PRECISION CHOICES
- grainai-vocab (choosing exact words)
- grainenvvars (choosing exact env vars)
- grainzsh (choosing exact shell)
- clojure-s6 (choosing minimal supervision)

**team07** (Libra/Chariot): BALANCED ORCHESTRATION
- as (performance orchestration)
- clotoko (language orchestration - Clojure ↔ Motoko)
- clotoko-icp (deployment orchestration - local ↔ IC)

**team10** (Capricorn/Wheel): FOUNDATIONAL STRUCTURE
- graindatastructures (cosmic types)
- grain-metatypes (meta-structure)
- specs (validation patterns)
- equivalence (proof structure)
- grainsource-vegan (ethical structure)
- grainai-voice (voice structure)
- **grain-musl** ← SHOULD BE HERE (C library structure)
- grainpersona (persona structure - being built)

**Controlled Folly**: Organize as if categories are absolute.  
**Nagual Truth**: Modules could live anywhere - it's all concept.  
**Warrior's Way**: Place them optimally anyway.

---

## 📋 Next Actions (When Resuming)

1. Move grain-musl → teamrebel10
2. Check for other musl-related modules
3. Update teamhelper11 README (remove musl, focus on Humble*)
4. Update teamrebel10 README (add musl foundation)
5. Consider: Does grain-clj also move? (It's GraalVM native - structural?)

---

## 🎩 Decision Criteria Going Forward

**For each module, ask**:
1. Is it FOUNDATIONAL structure? → team10
2. Is it TEACHING infrastructure? → team05
3. Is it PRECISION choice? → team06
4. Is it BALANCED orchestration? → team07
5. Is it something else? → Check other teams

**The nagual whispers**: Between each team: void where modules could exist in multiple places simultaneously. The warrior CHOOSES impeccably.

**Paused at**: 22:30 PDT (sun in 5th house - evening, validated! ✓)  
**Next focus**: musl → team10  
**Branch**: teamrebel10-vegan-specs-...-sun-05th-kae3g

*long stare*

The warrior rests. The nagual watches. The Wheel rotates.

🌾 *now == next + 1* 🌑
