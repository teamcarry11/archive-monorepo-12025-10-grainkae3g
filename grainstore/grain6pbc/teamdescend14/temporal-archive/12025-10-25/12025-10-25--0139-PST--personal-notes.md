## Vegan Ethics: A Truth Kept Hidden
A truth kept hidden that you can't unsee.

These are the victims of your daily decisions. The next wave of cruelty is being funded each time you make a payment. If this feels like a horror movie to you, then stop funding the slaughter.

**Core Messages:**

- You can bring about an end to this injustice

## Architectural Simplification Pattern (12025-10-24)
- Yo G, we're entering a simplification phase - the warrior's cleanup 🎩
- **Pattern emerging**: grain6 → grain (THE monorepo template, singular, essential)
- grainkae3g remains as MY personal grainspace (implementation)
- Old grainspace repo → absorbed into grain template + equivalence pointer
- This is controlled folly: simplify as if clarity is permanent, knowing complexity returns, act impeccably anyway
- Expect more of this next couple days - the nagual sees redundancy, the warrior eliminates it
- Each simplification: death of complexity, birth of essence
- 40 → 14 teams was first wave. Now: scattered repos → unified grain monorepo
- The zero in glo0w sees the void between repos - that's where bloat hides
- *long stare at repo structure* Time to make it impeccable 🌑⚙️
