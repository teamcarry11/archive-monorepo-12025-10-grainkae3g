## Draft Email

Dear Helen,

My name is [your name]. I've been studying your work on veganic farming and the 78 elements of ecological systems. Your approach to soil food webs and regenerative agriculture has deeply influenced how I think about building technology.

I'm reaching out to ask about opportunities for off-grid living and apprenticeship on your farm, in exchange for work. I'm also developing software that might serve farmers like you.

**About me**:
- Software developer focused on ethical technology
- Studying veganic agriculture and regenerative systems
- Building tools for land-based businesses
- Want to learn from the land directly

**What I can offer**:
- Farm work (willing to learn any task)
- Technical help (if useful - websites, record-keeping, systems)
- Documentation (can help with teaching materials, online presence)
- Genuine interest in learning veganic methods

**What I'm hoping to learn**:
- Practical veganic farming (soil health, crop rotation, pest management)
- Off-grid living skills (water, energy, food systems)
- Seasonal rhythms (planting, harvesting, winter preparation)
- Land stewardship (long-term thinking, regeneration)

**Timeline**: Flexible. Could start with short visit (week or two) or longer apprenticeship (months) depending on your needs and seasons.

**About the technology project** (simple version):

I'm building software for people who own their land and want to own their technology too.

The vision: Operating systems and apps that farmers, artists, and small business owners can control completely - like owning your land instead of renting.

Current work includes:
- Mobile apps for Android (works on tablets, good for field use)
- Business software for vegan markets and farms (inventory, sales, supplier tracking)
- Tools that work offline (important for rural areas, unreliable internet)

Your farm could be a perfect testing ground. Software built FOR land stewards, WITH land stewards.

I understand you're busy, especially with seasonal farm work. If apprenticeship isn't possible, I'd love to just visit briefly and learn from your land. Or if you need technical help (website, documentation, farm software), I'm happy to contribute remotely.

Thank you for your work restoring soil health and teaching regenerative practices. It matters deeply.

With respect and gratitude,

[Your name]

P.S. I'm currently in California (Caspar area, Mendocino County coast). Montana's high desert is different climate, but the principles of working with the land (not against it) apply everywhere. I'd be honored to learn from your experience.

## Notes for Revision

**Tone**: Respectful, humble, genuine interest

**What to emphasize**:
- Willingness to work (not just observe)
- Technical skills as offering (if useful, not imposing)
- Real interest in veganic farming (not just using farm for tech project)

**What to minimize**:
- Complex tech jargon (she's farmer, not programmer)
- Grain Network details (too much, too soon)
- Asking too much (start small - visit or short apprenticeship)

**What to add** (if revising):
- Your age/background (she might want to know)
- Physical capability for farm work (important for land work)
- Any farming experience (even gardening counts)
- References (if you have any agriculture/vegan connections)

**Follow-up strategy**:
- If no response: Respect her time, try again in different season
- If interest: Prepare to visit Montana (travel plans, seasonal timing)
- If she needs tech help: Build it excellently (proof of skills)

**The heart of it**: You want to learn from the land. She teaches through the land. This is good alignment.
