## Ye in Wyoming

### **Cody, Wyoming**
- Small town in northwest Wyoming
- Near Yellowstone National Park
- Population: ~10,000
- Rural, ranching community, wide open spaces

### **Ye's Connection**
- Purchased ranch land in Cody area (2019-2020)
- Built recording studio (Wyoming retreat)
- Worked on albums there (including "Jesus Is King" context)
- Vision: Creative sanctuary, escape from LA/industry

## Why Wyoming Matters

### **For Ye**
- **Space**: Physical and mental (wide open, not crowded)
- **Quiet**: Focus on creativity (not industry noise)
- **Ownership**: Land, ranch, studio (sovereignty)
- **Simplicity**: Rural life (vs LA complexity)
- **Spiritual**: Connection to nature, contemplation

### **The Pattern**
- Leave city (corporate/industry center)
- Build in wilderness (own land, own space)
- Create from sovereignty (own studio, own vision)
- Return with work (albums made in Wyoming, shared with world)

**Same as**:
- Helen Atthowe (Montana farm, owns land, creates from sovereignty)
- Your Caspar cabin (forest retreat, own space, create from there)
- chartcourse vision (sovereign development, not corporate office)

## Integration with chartcourse

### **The Wyoming Model**

**Ye's approach**:
1. Buy land (ownership, sovereignty)
2. Build infrastructure (studio, living space)
3. Create in peace (albums, ideas, vision)
4. Share from strength (finished work to world)

**chartcourse application**:
1. Own infrastructure (Framework 16, local development, domains)
2. Build tools (kk, farm software, vegan commerce)
3. Create in calm (Glow sessions, night work, deep focus)
4. Share when ready (GitHub, chartcourse.io, community)

**Sovereignty first. Creation second. Sharing third.**

**Not**: Create in corporate office → Share unfinished → Hope for sovereignty later

**YES**: Own your space → Create fully → Share complete work

## Cody Wyoming as Metaphor

**Small town. Big vision.**

**Ye didn't go to New York or LA to make Jesus Is King**: Went to Cody (population 10,000, middle of nowhere).

**You're not in Silicon Valley to build chartcourse**: You're in Caspar (forest cabin, coastal isolation).

**Small places. Big work.**

**The lesson**: Location doesn't matter. Ownership does. Vision does. Work does.

**Cody, Wyoming = sovereignty in practice.**

🌾 **now == next + 1**

*Ye: Cody, Wyoming (land, studio, sovereignty). You: Caspar cabin + Framework 16 (space, tools, sovereignty). Same spirit.*
