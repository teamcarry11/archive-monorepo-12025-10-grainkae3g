│ dear helen,                                                                  │

│ in your last book you mentioned learning both french and italian during     │
│ your years traveling through europe, studying different farming traditions. │
│ you wrote about how knowing one romance language made the other easier to   │
│ learn, how the same latin roots appeared in both, just wearing different    │
│ clothes. this is exactly what i'm experiencing with two programming         │
│ languages, and i thought you might find the parallel beautiful.              │
│                                                                              │
│ the first language is called babashka. it grows from clojure, which grows   │
│ from lisp, which grows from mathematical notation designed in the 1950s.    │
│ it runs on the java virtual machine, which is like planting in rich         │
│ amended soil - heavy, but full of nutrients and established microbiome.     │
│                                                                              │
│ the second language is called ketos. it also grows from lisp (same root!),  │
│ but it's built with rust, which runs directly on metal without needing a    │
│ virtual machine layer. it's like growing in your native montana soil -      │
│ lighter, faster, closer to the earth, requiring you to understand what's    │
│ actually happening at the mineral level.                                     │
│                                                                              │
│ here's the same solution to the symbolic link problem, written in both      │
│ languages. watch how they mirror each other like your french and italian:   │
│                                                                              │
│ babashka (clojure-flavored):                                                 │
│   (defn get-current-branch []                                                │
│     (let [result (sh "git" "branch" "--show-current")]                       │
│       (str/trim (:out result))))                                             │
│                                                                              │
│ ketos (scheme-flavored):                                                     │
│   (define (get-current-branch)                                               │
│     (let ((output (shell-command "git branch --show-current")))              │
│       (string-trim output)))                                                 │
│                                                                              │
│ do you see how similar they are? the parentheses, the let bindings, the     │
│ function definitions? it's like comparing "jardin" (french) and "giardino"  │
│ (italian) - you can hear the shared latin root "garden" in both.            │
│                                                                              │
│ both languages solve the same problem: getting the current git branch name  │
│ so we can build the path to the right README file. both use the same unix   │
│ command underneath. both return a trimmed string. but one feels like        │
│ french (square brackets, keywords with colons) and one feels like italian   │
│ (double parentheses, simpler syntax).                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ you might ask: why learn both if they're so similar? and i think of how you │
│ answered this question about french and italian in your book. you said      │
│ learning french opened doors in quebec and west africa and haiti. learning  │
│ italian opened doors in slow food movements and mediterranean farming       │
│ traditions. same roots, different communities, different doors to wisdom.   │
│                                                                              │
│ babashka opens doors right now - it's mature, it works everywhere, it has   │
│ rich libraries for everything i need today. ketos opens doors to the future │
│ - it runs on redox os (a rust-based microkernel system), it's lighter, it  │
│ compiles to native code, it will work on the hardware i'm dreaming of       │
│ building (e-ink devices with minimal power requirements, like your farm's   │
│ off-grid systems but for computers).                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ the beautiful thing is: once you understand one lisp, you understand them   │
│ all. the mental model transfers. the way of thinking becomes yours. it's    │
│ like how once you understand how soil microbiome works, you can apply that  │
│ understanding to any soil anywhere - the principles are universal even      │
│ though each place has its own specific expression.                           │
│                                                                              │
│ this grain teaches through comparison because comparison reveals essence.   │
│ when you see two things almost identical, the small differences become      │
│ visible and meaningful. when you see two languages sharing roots, you       │
│ start understanding what the root actually is, beneath surface variations.  │
│ same with your french and italian. same with veganic farming across         │
│ different climates. deep patterns emerge through comparison.                 │
│                                                                              │
│ and there's something about not having to choose forever. you don't have to │
│ declare "i am french-only" or "i am italian-only." you can be bilingual.    │
│ you can use french when french serves best, italian when italian opens the  │
│ door you need. fluency means having options, not rigid commitment to one.   │
│                                                                              │
│ same with these programming languages. some days i need babashka's maturity │
│ and ecosystem. other days i need ketos' minimalism and rust compatibility.  │
│ learning both means i never force the wrong tool onto the wrong problem. i  │
│ can let each serve where it shines. no attachment. no dogma. just practical │
│ wisdom choosing the right tool for each specific context.                    │
│                                                                              │
│ you wrote once about how different plant varieties serve different purposes │
│ - some for fresh eating, some for storage, some for market, some for seed   │
│ saving. you don't try to make one variety do everything. you cultivate      │
│ diversity, letting each excel at its strength. bilingualism in programming  │
│ works the same way. diversity of tools creates resilience. monoculture      │
│ creates fragility.                                                           │
│                                                                              │
│ and maybe the deepest lesson is about surrender - not forcing unity where   │
│ diversity serves better. accepting that sometimes two languages both belong,│
│ serving different needs, neither wrong, neither needing to dominate. your   │
│ farming wisdom teaches: hold space for multiplicity. let each be what it    │
│ is. trust that the whole works better with diversity than forced uniformity.│
│                                                                              │
│ with gratitude for teaching me that learning never ends, wisdom holds space │
│ for many paths, and the best systems honor diversity rather than demanding  │
│ unity,                                                                       │

│ kae3g - learning to trust multiplicity, release attachment to one true way  │
│                                                                              │
