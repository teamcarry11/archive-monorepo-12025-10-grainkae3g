Google Play compatibility while maintaining customization. Tesla app, Spotify, YouTube Music integration.

### grainredox
Redox OS (Rust microkernel). Desktop and mobile unified kernel.

Rust performance. Memory safety. Microkernel architecture with monolith benefits.

### grainnix
Nix package manager integration. Declarative builds. Reproducible systems.

Rust bindings for Redox. Alpine musl packages. NixOS/SixOS bridge.

### grainrisc
RISC-V architecture support. Nock integration. Urbit/Hoon bridge.

Specification-driven hardware. Open instruction set.

## The Vision

One OS. Multiple targets.

- Framework laptop (desktop)
- Daylight Computer (tablet)
- Android phone (mobile - GrapheneOS or standard with customization)

Unified codebase. Rust core. Nix packages. s6 supervision. musl libc. Boot-from-scratch capable.

---

## Technology Stack

**Core**: Rust (Redox microkernel)  
**Packages**: Nix + Alpine apk  
**Init**: s6  
**Libc**: musl  
**Architecture**: RISC-V + x86_64 + ARM

**Languages**:
- Rust (system, kernel, drivers)
- Nix (package definitions, builds)
- Clojure (application layer, scripting)
- Hoon (Urbit bridge, future)

---

## Integration Points

**ICP**: Canisters for cloud services  
**Hedera**: Fast consensus for payments  
**Solana L2**: Micropayments, instant transfers  
**Urbit**: Personal server, identity  
**Nostr**: Social, identity backup

Multi-chain. Protocol-native. Decentralized by design.

---

## Android Path

**Problem**: Need Google Play (Tesla, Spotify, YouTube Music) while maintaining sovereignty.

**Options**:
1. GrapheneOS with sandboxed Play Services
2. PostmarketOS with Waydroid
3. Standard Android with heavy customization
4. Wait for app ecosystem on alternative platforms

**Decision**: Evaluate all. Test thoroughly. Choose based on actual compatibility, not ideology.

---

## Framework Partnership

Pitch GrainOS to Framework. Request:
- Official hardware support
- Driver validation assistance
- Co-branding opportunity
- Paid development contracts

Show working prototype. Demonstrate value. Professional presentation.

---

## Redox + Alpine + NixOS + SixOS

Converge these into unified system:
- Redox kernel (Rust, microkernel)
- Alpine packages (musl, apk, minimal)
- Nix builds (declarative, reproducible)
- s6 init (simple supervision)

Name: GrainOS (or SixOS with Redox kernel)

Target: Framework 16, Daylight Computer, mobile devices.

---

## Contributing Upstream

Fork everything. Make improvements. Document thoroughly. Submit PRs.

- Redox: Rust contributions, driver work
- Nix: Rust bindings, package definitions
- Alpine: musl patches, apk packages
- s6: Clojure bindings, service templates

Build reputation as serious contributors. Not just users, but maintainers.

---

## RISC-V + Nock

RISC-V: Open ISA. Future-proof. Urbit-friendly.

Nock: Minimal VM. Hoon compiles to Nock. Potential for Nix→Nock, Clojure→Nock bridges.

Specification work first. Implementation follows.
