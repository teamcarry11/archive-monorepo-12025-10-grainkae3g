- Warm, respectful, student-to-teacher relationship
- Personal anecdotes about learning from her farm
- Questions that invite her wisdom
- Humble acknowledgment of her expertise

### Structure
- Start with farming observation or memory
- Connect to technical concept through analogy
- Develop the parallel with specific examples
- Show how farming wisdom illuminates tech problem
- Close with gratitude or reflection

### Language
- Flowing Oxford prose (not Hemingway terseness)
- Complete elegant sentences
- Only lowercase or UPPERCASE (no camelCase)
- Farming terminology used accurately
- Technical terms explained through farming lens

### Format
- Exactly 110 lines within 80×110 ASCII box
- Links at TOP (file path and live URL)
- Card number and `>` at bottom
- Metadata after closing fence

### Pedagogical Approach
- Make tech accessible to non-technical readers
- Show universal patterns across domains
- Value both ecological and computational thinking
- Bridge ancient farming wisdom with modern technology
- Demonstrate that all good design follows natural principles

## Future Expansion

As grainbook grows from 6 letters to 100 to 1,000+, Helen mode will continue providing the ecological lens that makes complex technology accessible to anyone who understands soil, seasons, and living systems.

**Target**: At least 100 Helen letters across the first 1,000 grains  
**Pace**: Mix Helen mode with other modes to provide variety  
**Quality**: Each letter must earn Helen's respect through accurate farming knowledge and genuine insight
