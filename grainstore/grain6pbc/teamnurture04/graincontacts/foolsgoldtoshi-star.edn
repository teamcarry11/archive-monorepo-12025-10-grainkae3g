 :notes
 "foolsgoldtoshi-star's work on sovereign monetary systems and multi-national economic democracy directly informs:
  
  1. graintalent approach to artist sovereignty (artists as nations)
  2. Grain Network's boot-from-scratch philosophy (technical sovereignty)
  3. Constitutional spec-writing (foundations before implementation)
  4. Rising sea method (patient, systemic, foundation-building)
  5. Letters to sovereign leaders (formal documentation, serious proposals)
  
  The parallel is precise:
  - foolsgoldtoshi-star : national leaders :: graintalent : artists :: Grain Network : developers
  - All three = sovereignty movements
  - All three = patient foundation-building
  - All three = constitutional/spec-driven
  - All three = long-term systemic change
  
  From sovereign monetary inquiry to sovereign artistic expression to sovereign computing:
  The same spirit. Own your work. Control your destiny. Build foundations that last."}
