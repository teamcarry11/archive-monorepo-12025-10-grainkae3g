}  replaces port completely&quot;\n  \n  :clobber-vs-merge\n  &quot;Two strategies for overriding:\n   - Clobber: Wipe out old value, use new one &#40;destructive&#41;\n   - Merge: Combine old and new &#40;additive&#41;\n   infuse lets you choose per-path&quot;\n  \n  :algebraic-laws\n  &quot;Mathematical properties that make infuse predictable:\n   - Identity: infuse target {} = target &#40;no change&#41;\n   - Associativity: infuse &#40;infuse x a&#41; b = infuse x &#40;a then b&#41;\n   These laws mean you can reason about combinations safely.&quot;\n  \n  :syntactic-sugar\n  &quot;Shortcuts that expand to full functions.\n   - &#95;&#95;assign = clobber &#40;replace&#41;\n   - &#95;&#95;append = add to list\n   - &#95;&#95;overlay = apply function to value\n   Custom sugars can be added for domain-specific tasks.&quot;}\n \n :why-it-matters-for-sixos\n &quot;SixOS uses infuse to treat services like Nix packages:\n  - Each service.nix is an attribute set\n  - Override ports, env vars, dependencies via paths\n  - Generate s6-rc service bundles &#40;directories with run scripts&#41;\n  - Enable multiple instances with different configs\n  \n  Traditional NixOS modules can't easily run multiple instances\n  of same service—infuse makes this trivial.&quot;}\n</code></pre><h3>Rich Hickey's \"Simple Made Easy\" Applied to infuse.nix</h3><h4>The Problem: Complexity vs Simplicity</h4><pre><code class=\"clojure\">{:rich-hickey-analysis\n {:complex-approach\n  &quot;Traditional Nix overrides are COMPLECTED &#40;braided together&#41;:\n   \n   pythonPackages.override &#40;prev: prev // {\n     packageOverrides = lib.composeExtensions \n       &#40;prev.packageOverrides or {}&#41;

class=\"clojure\">{:final-wisdom\n &quot;This learning plan is not just about init systems.\n  It's about mastering a way of thinking:\n  \n  1. Understand deeply &#40;first principles&#41;\n  2. Experiment boldly &#40;build prototypes&#41;\n  3. Measure rigorously &#40;benchmark everything&#41;\n  4. Simplify ruthlessly &#40;delete unnecessary complexity&#41;\n  5. Document thoroughly &#40;teach others&#41;\n  6. Iterate relentlessly &#40;version 1 is never the last&#41;\n  \n  These are the principles that make SpaceX rockets land,\n  that make xAI models converge,\n  that make great engineers.\n  \n  Your journey from 9999 &#40;Clojure/Nix ecosystem&#41;\n  through 9998 &#40;this learning plan&#41;\n  down to 0000 &#40;daily implementation&#41;\n  is the hero's journey in miniature:\n  \n  - Call to adventure: Why are init systems interesting?\n  - Trials: Building, breaking, fixing, learning\n  - Transformation: From student to contributor\n  - Return: Teaching others what you've learned\n  \n  May your code be elegant, your tests be thorough,\n  and your systems be reliable.&quot;}\n \n :from-the-i-ching\n &quot;Hexagram 53: Gradual Progress &#40;漸 Jiàn&#41;\n  \n  'The wild goose gradually draws near the shore.\n   The superior person improves their character through gradual progress.'\n  \n  Phase by phase, week by week, you ascend.\n  Not by leaping, but by steady, deliberate steps.\n  \n  This is the way of mastery.&quot;}\n</code></pre><h2></h2><p><strong>Next Writing:</strong> <a href='9997-framework-laptop-microkernel-dev'>9997-framework-laptop-microkernel-dev.md</a> — Framework Laptop Microkernel Development<br /> <strong>Previous Writing:</strong> <a href='9999-nixpkgs-clojure'>9999-nixpkgs-clojure.md</a> — Clojure & ClojureScript in the Nix Ecosystem<h2></h2></p><p><em>\"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"</em> — Laozi<br /> <em>\"The journey of mastering init systems begins with understanding PID 1.\"</em> — kae3g<br /></p><p><em>Start today.
