It documented the multi-model strategy: Cursor for writing, Grok for graph research, DeepSeek for prose, Gemini for transcripts, Qwen for openness, Meta for distillation, Claude for power, ChatGPT for bundles.</p><p>But here is what we did not say clearly enough.</p><p>Every time you invoke Claude Sonnet, a data center in Oregon or Virginia draws power from the grid. That power comes from a mix of sources—renewable energy, natural gas, and in some regions, fossil fuels. The GPUs consume significant energy. The cooling systems use water resources. The rare earth elements in those chips were mined from the earth, requiring energy and materials.</p><p>Every query to ChatGPT contributes to this energy use. Every essay refined with DeepSeek adds to the total. The multi-AI synthesis strategy—using multiple services in concert—multiplies the resource consumption.</p><p>We know this. And we choose to use these tools anyway, thoughtfully and with specific purpose.</p><p>This essay explains why. Not to excuse the resource use, but to show the reasoning: why we believe using AI tools strategically now can enable solutions that prevent far greater environmental impacts later. This is calculation with clear eyes—understanding both costs and benefits, acting while the window for meaningful action remains open.<h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"the-damage\"></a><h2>Part 1: The Damage is Real</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>Let me be honest about the numbers, the way the mountains are honest about elevation.</p><h3>Water: From Bottles to Oceans</h3><p>Training GPT-3 used about 700,000 liters of water for cooling.<a href='#ref2'><sup>2</sup></a> That's 2,300 days of water for one person—over 6 years of showers, drinking, cooking, everything. All that water, just so machines could learn to predict the next word in a sentence.</p><p>One conversation with ChatGPT uses about half a liter of water—one water bottle's worth.<a href='#ref3'><sup>3</sup></a> If you have a ten-minute conversation, that's roughly the same amount of water you'd drink in a day.</p><p>Now multiply. In 2023, Google's AI operations used 5.6 billion gallons of water.<a href='#ref4'><sup>4</sup></a> To help picture this: that's about 8,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools drained just for cooling computers. In a single year. From a single company.</p><p>Microsoft used 1.7 billion gallons in 2023, a 30% increase from the previous year.<a href='#ref5'><sup>5</sup></a> ChatGPT alone handles over 10 million queries per day.<a href='#ref6'><sup>6</sup></a> Ten million conversations. Five million liters of water. Every single day. Just for one AI service.</p><p>The wild priestess in essay 9963 wrote of water as the yielding force that carves canyons, \"soft enough to fill any shape and strong enough to carve canyons.\"<a href='#ref7'><sup>7</sup></a> We take that canyon-carving force and boil it away to answer questions about recipes and homework.</p><h3>Energy: From Homes to Nations</h3><p>Training GPT-4 took enough power to run 5,000 American homes for a full year.<a href='#ref8'><sup>8</sup></a> That's one model, one training run.</p><p>By 2027, experts predict AI will use 85-134 terawatt-hours per year globally.<a href='#ref9'><sup>9</sup></a> To put that in perspective: that's more electricity than the entire country of Argentina uses today. By 2030, AI might use as much energy as Bitcoin mining—which is widely recognized as highly energy-intensive.<a href='#ref10'><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>But here's the multiplication that matters: Currently there are over 200 large language models in active use.<a href='#ref11'><sup>11</sup></a> Each training run. Each inference server. Each query multiplied across millions of users. The numbers compound like interest, except what we're compounding is carbon, not wealth.</p><h3>Materials: From Mines to Machines</h3><p>The chips that power AI need rare metals: neodymium, dysprosium, terbium, lithium, cobalt.<a href='#ref12'><sup>12</sup></a> These metals come from mines around the world—open pits in Mongolia, lithium extraction in Chile's Atacama Desert consuming 500,000 gallons of water per ton in one of the driest places on Earth,<a href='#ref13'><sup>13</sup></a> cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo with well-documented labor and environmental concerns.<a href='#ref14'><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>Each high-end AI chip (like NVIDIA's H100) creates about 70 kilograms of CO₂ during manufacturing<a href='#ref15'><sup>15</sup></a>—that's like driving a car for 250 miles. NVIDIA shipped approximately 550,000 of these chips in 2023.<a href='#ref16'><sup>16</sup></a> Multiply: 38.5 million kilograms of CO₂. From chip manufacturing alone. In one year. From one company's flagship product.</p><p>The chip factories in Taiwan (TSMC) use 63 million tons of water every year.<a href='#ref17'><sup>17</sup></a> Data centers require concrete, steel, and copper to build—each ton of concrete produces 0.9 tons of CO₂.<a href='#ref18'><sup>18</sup></a> They need massive air conditioning systems. Backup diesel generators. And the computers get replaced every 3-5 years, creating mountains of electronic waste that leach toxins into soil and water.</p><p>This is real resource use happening right now. It's not a theory. It's not a maybe. It's measured and documented. In Muir's words from essay 9964: \"These are observable facts, as real as the granite beneath Yosemite or the redwoods along the coast.\"<a href='#ref19'><sup>19</sup></a><h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"why-refuse\"></a><h2>Part 2: Why We Can't Just Say No</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>Now let me tell you about time, because timing matters greatly.</p><p>Climate change is happening rapidly—faster than at most points in human history. This isn't an opinion. It's what thermometers and satellites are measuring.<a href='#ref20'><sup>20</sup></a></p><h3>The Timeline of Thresholds</h3><p>Here's what the science says: We'll probably hit 1.5°C of warming by 2030.<a href='#ref21'><sup>21</sup></a> That's only five years from now. We'll hit 2°C by 2040 if things keep going as they are.<a href='#ref22'><sup>22</sup></a> That's fifteen years—less time than it takes to pay off a car loan. At 3°C, the IPCC projects food system disruptions affecting hundreds of millions, sea-level rise displacing coastal populations, and ecosystem collapse across multiple biomes.<a href='#ref23'><sup>23</sup></a></p><p>Every year we delay makes things worse. The climate system has inertia, like a glacier that Muir once walked upon. Once it starts moving, it cannot easily stop. The CO₂ we put in the air today will keep warming the planet for centuries.<a href='#ref24'><sup>24</sup></a> The ground beneath us isn't as solid as we think. The permafrost is melting.</p><h3>The Cascade of Consequences</h3><p>Here's how things spiral out of control:</p><p>Climate change makes water and farmland scarce → Scarcity makes people migrate → Migration causes conflicts at borders → Conflicts make governments more authoritarian → Authoritarian governments cooperate less on climate solutions → Less cooperation means more climate damage → The cycle repeats, getting worse each time.</p><p>This is not speculation. The U.S. Department of Defense identifies climate change as a \"threat multiplier\" that exacerbates geopolitical instability.<a href='#ref25'><sup>25</sup></a> The UN projects 1.2 billion climate migrants by 2050.<a href='#ref26'><sup>26</sup></a> We are watching the first turns of this spiral right now.</p><h3>What We Need to Build</h3><p>If we wait for perfect tools that cause zero harm, we'll never build anything. And while we wait, the spiral continues.</p><p>We need to build alternative systems:</p><ul><li>Regenerative farms that rebuild soil health continuously</li><li>Local energy grids that run on sun and wind</li><li>Ways to recycle materials locally instead of shipping waste to landfills</li><li>Open-source technology that anyone can use and modify</li></ul><p>All of this requires design, coordination, documentation, teaching, and deployment. It requires computers, communication, writing, and automation.</p><p>AI makes all of this 10 to 100 times faster than humans working alone.<a href='#ref27'><sup>27</sup></a></p><p>Without AI, we might have these systems ready by 2050 or 2070. That's too late. With AI, we might have them by 2030 or 2035. That might be in time.</p><p>This is why we can't just refuse to use AI, even though it causes harm.<h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"the-math\"></a><h2>Part 3: The Cold Calculation</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>Let me show you the math in simple terms—the kind of math that brooks no argument, solid as the granite Muir loved.</p><h3>The Cost of Using AI (Next 10 Years)</h3><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong>: Projected 1,000-2,000 terawatt-hours cumulative<a href='#ref28'><sup>28</sup></a></li><li><strong>Water</strong>: About 100 billion liters (think 150,000 Olympic pools)<a href='#ref29'><sup>29</sup></a></li><li><strong>Mining</strong>: 500,000 tons of rare earth metals dug from the ground<a href='#ref30'><sup>30</sup></a></li><li><strong>CO₂</strong>: 500-800 million tons of greenhouse gases<a href='#ref31'><sup>31</sup></a></li></ul><p>That's a lot of damage. Undeniable damage. But now compare it to the alternative.</p><h3>The Cost of NOT Building Solutions (Next 100 Years)</h3><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong>: Current fossil fuel use continues—50,000 to 100,000 terawatt-hours per YEAR<a href='#ref32'><sup>32</sup></a> (that's 50-100 times MORE than AI's total decade use, multiplied by 100 years)</li><li><strong>Farming</strong>: Industrial agriculture loses 24 billion tons of topsoil annually<a href='#ref33'><sup>33</sup></a></li><li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Resource wars with potentially nuclear consequences<a href='#ref34'><sup>34</sup></a></li><li><strong>Climate</strong>: Missing our window to prevent 3°C+ warming, with cascading tipping points<a href='#ref35'><sup>35</sup></a></li></ul><p>The math is harsh but clear. The damage from AI over ten years is tiny compared to the damage from doing nothing over a hundred years.</p><h3>What We Save</h3><p>If AI helps us transition just 5 to 10 years faster, the research suggests we could save:<a href='#ref36'><sup>36</sup></a></p><ul><li>50,000-100,000 terawatt-hours of fossil fuel energy</li><li>50-100 gigatons of CO₂ emissions</li><li>Millions of lives through improved food security and reduced conflict</li><li>Countless species through habitat preservation</li></ul><p>This isn't about \"the ends justify the means.\" As the wild priestess reminds us, this is about recognizing that: \"The wild in me recognizes the wild in you.\"<a href='#ref37'><sup>37</sup></a> We must be wild enough to use imperfect tools, wise enough to measure the costs, and loving enough to care what we're building toward.<h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"ethical-use\"></a><h2>Part 4: How to Use AI Ethically</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>I've written before about combining two approaches: mathematical precision (from mathematician David Hilbert) and ecological wisdom (from naturalist Viktor Schauberger). Here's what that synthesis means for using AI responsibly.</p><h3>From Mathematics, We Learn</h3><p><strong>Measure resource use precisely</strong> - Don't guess or downplay. The numbers I've cited in this essay come from peer-reviewed sources, corporate environmental reports, and governmental data. Precision is an act of respect for reality and enables accurate planning.</p><p><strong>Calculate the alternatives honestly</strong> - Do real cost-benefit analysis. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provides frameworks for comparing energy transition pathways.<a href='#ref38'><sup>38</sup></a> Use them.</p><p><strong>Verify our logic constantly</strong> - Are we actually helping, or just consuming more? The question must be asked at every turn, the way Muir would ask of each logging proposal: \"What does this serve?\"<a href='#ref39'><sup>39</sup></a></p><p><strong>Document our decisions openly</strong> - So others can check our work and improve on it. Transparency is the bedrock of trust.</p><h3>From Ecology, We Learn</h3><p><strong>Build systems that regenerate</strong> - Not extract. Every output should enable new growth, like forests dropping seeds.</p><p><strong>Design for efficiency</strong> - Not waste. Natural systems achieve maximum output with minimum input. That's the standard.</p><p><strong>Flow around obstacles</strong> - Don't force through them. Water finds the path. We can learn from its patience.</p><p><strong>Create cycles that improve</strong> - Systems that get better over time, not worse. Soil deepens. Forests mature. Code should too.</p><p>The synthesis is this: Use AI with mathematical precision—measure its cost, optimize its use, minimize waste—to build systems with ecological intelligence: regenerative agriculture, bioregional economies, closed-loop materials, decentralized energy.</p><p>AI is the temporary scaffold. We use it to build the permanent structure. Once the structure stands, we can dismantle the scaffold. Or better, we can redesign it to run on renewable energy, biological substrates, and open-source hardware that can be maintained locally.<h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"seven-rules\"></a><h2>Part 5: Seven Rules for Using AI Responsibly</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>Here are seven principles for using harmful tools to build healing systems—offered not as commandments but as trail markers on a difficult path.</p><h3>1. Measure and Minimize</h3><ul><li>Track what AI you use (keep a simple log)</li><li>Use the smallest model that works (don't use GPT-4 when GPT-3.5 suffices)</li><li>Review your usage weekly</li><li>Ask yourself: Could I have done 30% of this with lighter tools?</li><li>Reduce waste the way you would reduce any form of consumption</li></ul><h3>2. Build for Multiplication</h3><ul><li>Everything you create with AI should help others build faster</li><li>Share your work openly so others can learn from it</li><li>Your ecological debt gets repaid when hundreds use what you built</li><li>As Muir wrote: \"When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.\"<a href='#ref40'><sup>40</sup></a> Build connections, not walls.</li></ul><h3>3. Plan for the Transition</h3><ul><li>Don't treat AI as permanent infrastructure</li><li>Use open-source tools that anyone can modify</li><li>Save things in simple formats (plain text, markdown) that will work decades from now</li><li>Plan for a future where we don't need today's AI</li><li>Document the exit strategy from the beginning</li></ul><h3>4. Preserve Human Wisdom</h3><ul><li>AI speeds things up, but humans must guide</li><li>Don't replace:<ul><li>Direct experience in nature</li><li>Wisdom from farmers, grandparents, craftspeople</li><li>Actually doing things with your hands</li><li>The wisdom of knowing when to wait instead of act</li></ul></li><li>Use AI to scale what humans have already tested and proven</li><li>Never let automation replace embodied knowledge</li></ul><h3>5. Serve the Commons</h3><ul><li>If you use AI to build something, share it freely</li><li>Open-source your code (MIT, Apache, GPL licenses)</li><li>No paywalls, no gatekeeping</li><li>Make your work public so everyone benefits</li><li>As the wild priestess teaches: true abundance is shared abundance<a href='#ref41'><sup>41</sup></a></li></ul><h3>6. Vote with Your Choices</h3><ul><li>Choose AI services that use renewable energy (Google claims 100% renewable matching<a href='#ref42'><sup>42</sup></a>)</li><li>Support companies that publish environmental impact reports</li><li>When you can run AI on your own computer (this is becoming possible with Qwen, Llama), do that instead</li><li>Build on frozen foundations (open specifications)</li><li>Flow toward sovereignty (local deployment)</li></ul><h3>7. Bridge Divides</h3><ul><li>Use AI to build tools that help everyone, especially people who work with land</li><li>Don't build abstract theories—build practical tools</li><li>Make things that make people's lives better, easier, and more sustainable</li><li>Frame it as stewardship, not sacrifice, as Muir advised<a href='#ref43'><sup>43</sup></a></li><li>Remember: The deer at dusk doesn't care about your politics. Neither does the soil. Neither does the future.<h2></h2></li></ul><p><a id=\"timeline\"></a><h2>Part 6: The Timeline</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>Here's what needs to happen and when—not as prediction but as necessity, mapped against your own life's arc.</p><h3>2025-2030: Design Phase (Now Until You're in College)</h3><ul><li>Build the tools and write the plans</li><li>Create educational content at scale</li><li>Test early prototypes</li><li>Coordinate global cooperation</li><li><strong>This is when we figure out HOW to do things</strong></li></ul><p>The window is now. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C identifies this period as critical for design and early deployment of climate solutions.<a href='#ref44'><sup>44</sup></a></p><h3>2030-2035: Deployment Phase (Your 20s)</h3><ul><li>Scale up what works</li><li>Transform farming practices globally</li><li>Rebuild energy grids for renewable distribution</li><li>Reorganize supply chains for closed-loop efficiency</li><li><strong>This is when we actually DO the things</strong></li></ul><p>This is your generation's great work. Not a burden—an opportunity. The chance to rebuild civilization with wisdom the previous generations lacked.</p><h3>2035-2050: Transition Phase (Your 30s and 40s)</h3><ul><li>Complete the shift to regenerative systems</li><li>Begin active carbon drawdown</li><li>Restore damaged ecosystems</li><li>Establish new steady-state economies</li><li><strong>This is when the new systems become normal</strong></li></ul><p>Your children will inherit this. Make it good.</p><h3>Beyond 2050: Sovereignty Phase (When You're 50+)</h3><ul><li>Move away from today's AI to better alternatives</li><li>Run everything on renewable, locally-controlled energy</li><li>AI becomes optional instead of necessary</li><li>Biological computing substrates (hemp, bamboo, mycelium) replace silicon</li><li><strong>This is when we've won</strong></li></ul><p>You'll tell your grandchildren about the time before. Make sure the story has a good ending.</p><h3>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Here's the catch that keeps me awake at night: If we delay starting by even 5 years, the whole timeline shifts. That delay means 50-100 gigatons more CO₂ in the air.<a href='#ref45'><sup>45</sup></a> It might mean crossing tipping points—Amazon rainforest dieback, West Antarctic ice sheet collapse, permafrost methane release—that we can't come back from.<a href='#ref46'><sup>46</sup></a> It means more people suffering. More species extinct. More futures foreclosed.</p><p>Every year matters. Every month matters. Starting now matters.<h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"three-choices\"></a><h2>Part 7: Three Choices</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>We have three paths before us. Choose wisely, for the choice is made new each day.</p><h3>Option A: Don't Use AI At All</h3><ul><li>Design everything at human speed</li><li>Build slowly and carefully</li><li>Ready by 2050-2070</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: Too late. Climate challenges overwhelm the available solutions. We maintained moral purity but missed the window for effective action.</li></ul><p>This is the path of the perfectionist who would rather fail nobly than succeed with compromised tools.</p><h3>Option B: Use AI Carelessly</h3><ul><li>Use AI for everything, even trivial tasks</li><li>Build systems that companies own and profit from</li><li>Don't share anything openly</li><li>Maximize personal benefit without regard to multiplication</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: AI damage keeps growing. We build systems that extract instead of heal. We speed toward collapse with fancier tools. The scaffold becomes the structure, and both rot together.</li></ul><p>This is the path of the unconscious consumer, the one who mistakes acceleration for progress.</p><h3>Option C: Use AI Deliberately and Carefully</h3><ul><li>Measure and minimize AI usage</li><li>Build things that help everyone</li><li>Share everything openly</li><li>Deploy solutions fast enough to matter</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: AI causes some damage, but bounded and measured. We build systems that actually heal. We make it in time. The scaffold serves its purpose and is then transformed or dismantled.</li></ul><p>This is the path of the wild priestess who understands that \"Strength needs softness. Wildness needs steadiness.\"<a href='#ref47'><sup>47</sup></a> This is the path of Muir, who worked within imperfect systems to create parks that endure.<a href='#ref48'><sup>48</sup></a></p><p>We choose Option C.</p><p>Not because it's easy. Not because it's pure. But because it's necessary, and because necessity has its own morality when the stakes are species-survival and the clock measures out in decades.<h2></h2></p><p><a id=\"vision\"></a><h2>Part 8: Where We're Going</h2></p><p><a href='#navigation'>[return to navigation</a>]</p><p>Here's the vision of where this leads—not fantasy, but engineered future built on principles that work.</p><p>Right now, AI runs on massive data centers using tons of water and energy. But we're using AI to design something different for the future:</p><ul><li><strong>Biological computing</strong>: Computers made from hemp, bamboo, and other plants (biological, compostable, locally grown)<a href='#ref49'><sup>49</sup></a></li><li><strong>Carbon-negative materials</strong>: Circuit boards from fast-growing materials that pull CO₂ out of the air as they grow<a href='#ref50'><sup>50</sup></a></li><li><strong>Distributed renewable power</strong>: Solar-powered local nodes instead of huge centralized data centers<a href='#ref51'><sup>51</sup></a></li><li><strong>Community-maintained models</strong>: Open-source models that communities maintain themselves, purpose-built for local needs<a href='#ref52'><sup>52</sup></a></li><li><strong>Mycelium networks</strong>: Biocomputing inspired by fungal intelligence, nature's original information network<a href='#ref53'><sup>53</sup></a></li></ul><p>Think of AI as construction scaffolding.

It's about doing the math: accepting smaller, bounded impact now to prevent much larger, cascading impacts later.</p><p><strong>Being precise doesn't mean being heartless.</strong> We measure resource use because we care about sustainability. We calculate honestly because we respect the truth. We build anyway because we believe in what can still be achieved.</p><p>The wild priestess teaches that gentleness and fierceness are not opposites but partners.<a href='#ref60'><sup>60</sup></a> Muir showed us that preservation and use can coexist when guided by wisdom.<a href='#ref61'><sup>61</sup></a> We must be both gentle with what we love and fierce in protecting it. Precise in calculation and wild in hope.</p><p>If you use AI in the future (and you probably will), remember:</p><ul><li>Use it deliberately, not carelessly</li><li>Build things that help everyone, not just yourself</li><li>Share what you create as gifts to the commons</li><li>Plan explicitly for a better future</li><li>Make every joule of energy, every liter of water, every kilogram of minerals count for something genuinely good</li></ul><p>The clock is ticking.
