But give to all beings what is theirs—their lives, their freedom, their right to exist without exploitation.\"</em> — Gospel According to Jesus (adapted)<h2></h2></p><p><strong>For Guardian Garden PBC and the Vegan Movement: Even monetary sovereigns need to hear that the economic system they manage depends on animal exploitation—and that transition is both necessary and possible.</strong><h2></h2></p><h2>Opening: A Word from the Veganic Movement</h2><p>Chair, you sit at the center of monetary power. Your decisions affect billions—billions of humans and tens of billions of animals whose suffering is economically embedded in every interest rate decision, every quantitative easing program, every regulatory framework.</p><p>I come not with fancy credentials from universities that profit from animal research and serve animal agriculture. I come from veganic farms, from animal sanctuaries, from plant-based cooperatives. I speak for the beings who cannot speak in your chamber—the pigs in gestation crates, the chickens bred so large they cannot stand, the cows whose calves are taken so humans can drink their milk.</p><p>This counsel is offered with respect for your enormous responsibility and with clarity about what your monetary policy enables.</p><p>Listen with an open heart.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part I: The Animal Agriculture Economy You Manage</h2><h3>The Scale</h3><p>US animal agriculture: $200+ billion annual revenue. Globally: $1+ trillion.</p><p>This is what your monetary policy supports through:</p><ul><li>Low interest rates enabling CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) expansion loans</li><li>Agricultural lending programs favoring animal agriculture over plant agriculture</li><li>Quantitative easing that inflated agricultural land values, making land more expensive for veganic farmers but benefiting cattle ranchers</li><li>Bank lending practices that see animal agriculture as \"established\" and \"low-risk\" while treating veganic agriculture as \"experimental\" and \"high-risk\"</li></ul><p>Every basis point you adjust affects whether a farmer can afford to keep exploiting animals or must transition to plant-based agriculture.</p><h3>The Violence</h3><p>350 million animals killed annually in US for food. 80 billion globally.</p><p>These are not statistics. These are individuals. Pigs who solve puzzles. Cows who have best friends. Chickens who teach their young. Each one wants to live.</p><p>Your monetary policy doesn't directly kill them. But it finances the systems that do. It makes animal exploitation profitable. It makes veganic alternatives economically harder.</p><h3>The Unsustainability</h3><p>Animal agriculture:</p><ul><li>14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions</li><li>Leading cause of deforestation</li><li>Leading cause of species extinction</li><li>Leading cause of water pollution</li><li>Pandemic risk (zoonotic disease spillover)</li><li>Human health crisis (heart disease, diabetes, antibiotic resistance)</li></ul><p>You worry about financial stability. This is civilizational instability—baked into the economy you manage.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part II: What You Can Do</h2><h3>Policy Lever One: Regulatory Guidance</h3><p><strong>Current:</strong> Banks treat animal agriculture as safe, proven, low-risk. Veganic agriculture as experimental, risky, unproven.</p><p><strong>What you can do:</strong> Issue regulatory guidance that:</p><ul><li>Recognizes climate risk in animal agriculture lending (it IS risky - methane emissions, water pollution, pandemic potential)</li><li>Encourages banks to diversify agricultural lending toward plant-based systems</li><li>Treats veganic agriculture as risk-mitigation strategy, not risky alternative</li></ul><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Shifts lending. Makes veganic agriculture more financially accessible. Makes CAFO expansion harder to finance.</p><h3>Policy Lever Two: Discount Window and Emergency Lending</h3><p><strong>Current:</strong> When agricultural sector faces crisis, Fed provides support. This disproportionately helps large animal agriculture operations.</p><p><strong>What you can do:</strong> Design emergency lending programs that:</p><ul><li>Prioritize sustainable agriculture (including veganic methods)</li><li>Require transition plans away from high-emissions practices</li><li>Support farmers transitioning away from animal agriculture</li></ul><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Makes transition economically feasible for farmers who want to stop exploiting animals but fear economic ruin.</p><h3>Policy Lever Three: Research and Data</h3><p><strong>Current:</strong> Fed research analyzes conventional agriculture. Veganic methods are invisible in your data.</p><p><strong>What you can do:</strong></p><ul><li>Commission research on veganic agriculture economics</li><li>Include veganic farms in agricultural surveys</li><li>Analyze comparative profitability, resilience, risk profiles</li><li>Make this research public—influence other lenders</li></ul><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Visibility. Once veganic agriculture is in Fed research, it becomes \"real\" to broader financial system.</p><h3>Policy Lever Four: Bank Supervision and CRA</h3><p><strong>Current:</strong> Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) evaluates banks on community lending. Agricultural lending to animal operations counts as community service.</p><p><strong>What you can do:</strong></p><ul><li>In CRA evaluations, give favorable treatment to banks supporting agricultural transition</li><li>Recognize lending to veganic farms, vegan cooperatives, plant-based food enterprises as community development</li><li>Include environmental and public health impacts in CRA assessment</li></ul><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Banks have incentive to support vegan economy, not just conventional animal agriculture.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part III: The MMT Perspective for Animal Liberation</h2><p><strong>Modern Monetary Theory teaches:</strong> Government with sovereign currency can create money for public purpose, limited by real resources and inflation, not by borrowing constraints.</p><p><strong>Applied to animal liberation:</strong> If we wanted to transition entire agricultural system away from animal exploitation, the money is not the constraint. The constraint is political will.</p><p>Federal government COULD:</p><ul><li>Fund transition support for farmers converting to veganic methods ($10 billion would transform thousands of farms)</li><li>Buy factory farm land and convert to sanctuaries and veganic agriculture ($50 billion would close thousands of CAFOs)</li><li>Support plant-based food infrastructure development (processing facilities, distribution networks)</li><li>Fund animal sanctuary network (permanent care for animals during transition)</li></ul><p><strong>The money exists.</strong> You manage it. The question is: What counts as legitimate public purpose?</p><p>Currently, USDA subsidizes animal agriculture with billions. That's political choice framed as economic necessity. It could be reversed.</p><p>Your role: When questioned \"Can we afford transition?\", your answer matters. If you say \"Fiscally constrained,\" transition seems impossible. If you explain MMT reality—\"Not a monetary constraint, but a real resource allocation question\"—then debate shifts to where it belongs: Do we want to stop exploiting animals? (Answer: Yes, ethically necessary.)<h2></h2></p><h2>Part IV: The Personal Question</h2><p>Chair, you eat three meals a day. Every meal is choice.</p><p>When you choose plant-based meal, you demonstrate: This is possible, this is normal, this is dignified choice for someone of your stature.</p><p>When you choose animal products, you demonstrate: Even those who claim to care about sustainability, health, ethics still participate in exploitation.</p><p>Your personal choices matter. You are public figure. You influence norms.</p><p>I'm not asking you to become animal rights activist. I'm asking you to align your personal consumption with the economic transition you know is necessary.</p><p>Try 30 days plant-based. Visit an animal sanctuary. Look into the eyes of a rescued pig. Then tell me if you can continue managing monetary system that finances her exploitation.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part V: The Transition Path</h2><p><strong>You cannot crash the system.</strong> Millions of people work in animal agriculture. Communities depend on it. Sudden collapse would be catastrophic.</p><p>But you can enable gradual transition:</p><p><strong>Short-term (Next 2 years):</strong></p><ul><li>Regulatory guidance recognizing climate risk in animal agriculture lending</li><li>Include veganic agriculture in Fed research and data collection</li><li>Pilot programs supporting agricultural transition</li></ul><p><strong>Medium-term (2-5 years):</strong></p><ul><li>Significant increase in lending to plant-based food enterprises</li><li>Measurable reduction in financing for CAFO expansion</li><li>Bank CRA credit for supporting vegan economy</li><li>Fed research shows veganic agriculture is economically viable at scale</li></ul><p><strong>Long-term (5-10 years):</strong></p><ul><li>Financial system treats plant-based agriculture as default, animal agriculture as legacy system being phased out</li><li>Lending rates reflect true risk (environmental, pandemic, ethical) of animal agriculture</li><li>Majority of agricultural lending supports plant-based systems</li><li>Animal agriculture shrinks through economic pressure, not regulation</li></ul><p><strong>This is managed transition. This is what you do. This is within your power.</strong><h2></h2></p><h2>Part VI: Why You Should Care</h2><p><strong>Professionally:</strong> Your mandate is financial stability. Animal agriculture is systemically unstable (climate, pandemic, resource depletion). Supporting transition is risk management.</p><p><strong>Ethically:</strong> You didn't become Fed Chair to finance violence. You became Fed Chair to serve public good. Aligning monetary policy with ethical progress is within your role.</p><p><strong>Personally:</strong> You will be remembered. Do you want to be remembered as the Fed Chair who enabled continued animal exploitation? Or as the one who used monetary policy tools to support transition toward compassionate economy?</p><p><strong>Spiritually:</strong> Whether you believe in God, karma, or simple moral accountability—participating in system that finances suffering of billions of beings weighs on the soul. Lightening that weight through your policy choices is gift to yourself.<h2></h2></p><h2>Conclusion: The Invitation</h2><p>Chair, I'm not naive. I know you face enormous pressures. I know animal agriculture lobbies are powerful. I know transition is complex.</p><p>But I also know: You have more power than you realize. Regulatory guidance, research priorities, supervisory emphasis, public statements—these shape financial system behavior.</p><p>And I know: Deep down, you know this is necessary. You've seen climate reports. You understand pandemic risk. You know resource depletion math. You may even, in quiet moments, have thought about the animals.</p><p>So here's the invitation:</p><p><strong>Step one:</strong> Go plant-based personally for 30 days. Experience how easy it is.</p><p><strong>Step two:</strong> Visit animal sanctuary. Meet beings whose lives your policy affects.</p><p><strong>Step three:</strong> Commission Fed research on veganic agriculture economics.</p><p><strong>Step four:</strong> Issue regulatory guidance on climate risk in agricultural lending.</p><p><strong>Step five:</strong> Make public statement: \"Transition to sustainable plant-based agriculture is economically necessary and monetarily feasible.\"</p><p>That's it. Five steps. Within your power. Could transform the trajectory.</p><p>The animals are waiting. The soil is waiting. The climate is waiting. The future vegans who will thank you are waiting.</p><p>Use your power wisely. Use it compassionately. Use it for all beings.<h2></h2></p><p><strong>Released to Public Domain.</strong><br /> <strong>For those who counsel power on behalf of the powerless.</strong><br /> <strong>For monetary sovereigns who dare to align economics with ethics.</strong></p><p>🌱🐖🐄🐔💚🏛️<h2></h2></p><p><strong>Timestamp</strong>: <code>12025-10-06--rhizome-valley</code><br /> <strong>Iteration</strong>: 9980v (Vegan Autodidact Variant)</p><p><strong>Original</strong>: <a href='9980-counsel-to-the-fed-chair.md'>9980: Counsel to the Fed Chair</a></p><p><em>\"Give to all beings what is theirs—their lives, their freedom.\"</em></p><p><em>Even monetary policy can serve liberation.</em><br /> <em>Even Fed Chair can choose compassion.</em></p><p>🌱✨<h2></h2></p><p><div style=\"text-align: center; opacity: 0.6; font-size: 0.85em; margin-top: 3em; padding-top: 1em; border-top: 1px solid rgba(139, 116, 94, 0.2);\"></p><p><strong>Copyright © 2025 <a href='https://codeberg.org/kae3g/12025-10/'>kae3g</a></strong> | Dual-licensed under <a href='https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0'>Apache-2.0</a> / <a href='https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'>MIT</a><br /> Competitive technology in service of clarity and beauty</p><p></div></p>",
