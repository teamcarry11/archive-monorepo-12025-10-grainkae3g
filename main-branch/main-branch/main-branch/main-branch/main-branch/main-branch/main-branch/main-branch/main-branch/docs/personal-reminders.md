## Screenshot Analysis: EEL Lab Teaching Page
Screenshot of the Ecohydraulics and Ecomorphodynamics Laboratory (EEL) teaching page at UIUC, showing students conducting fieldwork in a bright green-dyed stream. The image captures environmental science education in action - students in winter gear measuring water flow with tracer dye studies, standing on a stone bridge over a rocky stream. This sparks ideas for Grain Network software specifically designed for environmental science and engineering labs - tools for data collection, analysis, and visualization in field studies, with immutable data trails and decentralized collaboration capabilities.

## Screenshot Analysis: Grain Emoji Search
Screenshot of Google search results for "grain emoji" showing 20+ grain-related emojis in a 2x3 grid. Notable emojis include golden sheaf of rice with green leaves, stylized grain stalks, and simplified grain icons. Perfect for Grain Network branding and UI elements - could use these emojis in the gt command output, graincourse lessons, and grainweb interface. The variety of styles (realistic vs stylized) offers options for different contexts. 🌾
